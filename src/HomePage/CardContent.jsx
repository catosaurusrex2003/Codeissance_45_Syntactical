                    <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
                    <h3>FINANCIAL PLAN</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anita and Raju are two children wondering why their parents are always debating over
                        household expenses. They often, hear them talk about saving for buying another car, new
                        model of television, double-door refrigerator, latest model of washing machine and so
                        on. There seems to be a never ending list and nobody seems to agree upon any purchase
                        of a particular item. The children desire an LCD television set, their mother wants a
                        refrigerator while father wants to possess a new car and grandparents want to deposit
                        money in the bank to be used at a later date. The priorities of the family members differ
                        in terms of their needs, utility and the price of various household items. However, all of
                        them are making a choice which has financial implications for the family. The option will
                        require a careful analysis of the families’ income, expenses and savings. Since the
                        amount of money available with the family is limited, some purchases may have to be
                        deferred or postponed to a future date. Therefore, it would be appropriate if they decide
                        in advance what to buy keeping in view their income and expenses. They take a decision
                        to purchase a car as it would serve the interest of all and everyone will enjoy its benefits.
                        All of us at some time or the other have taken major and minor financial decisions in
                        our life. Your parents may have asked you to choose between going for a school trip or
                        purchase a new computer game. The school trip may cost `. 3000/- and the computer
                        game `. 3500/-. Even if you do not have any income you have been involved in financial
                        decision making. Sometimes your parents may have deferred buying you a new bicycle
                        because their house loan instalment had to be paid. We are all part of the financial
                        decision making process and are affected by our family’s financial situation. You have
                        observed in your daily life that spending, financing, investing are becoming part of your
                        routine activities. These decisions are all components of personal finance. Therefore,
                        personal finance can be said to be the process of planning your spending, financing and
                        investing activities that affect your financial situation. However, before you begin to
                        plan, you will have to think about your needs and then accordingly prioritise your goals.

                <div id="item-2">
                    <h5>2</h5>
                        <p>
                            Thus, the process of financial planning will include two steps:
                            (i) to specify your goals, and
                            (ii) to describe your spending, financing and investing plans to achieve those goals.
                            Financial planning helps you to ensure that you will have funds available to meet your
                            present as well as future needs.
                            In India, there is a culture of saving for some future event or contingency or an asset to be
                            acquired. Usually, some money is kept aside for this if it is surplus. In the middle income
                            groups, there may be little or no savings due to high prices of essential items. This is
                            where it becomes important to think of a personal financial plan. In contrast in advanced
                            countries, like America, individuals tend to rely too much on credit cards which
                            sometimes puts them in debt. They do not think of saving money and usually spend all
                            their monthly income. Despite the difference in the cultural as well as economic position
                            of the countries all individuals need to plan their finances in order to have some surplus
                            and avoid debt.
                            When people or households do not have any savings, it becomes problematic in difficult
                            times or emergencies like paying for hospital expenses, repairs in case of accident or
                            other necessities. Similarly, if you have savings then there are numerous options to
                            channelise your savings such as like bank deposits, insurance plans, shares etc. Thus,
                            being financially prepared for such exigencies makes life much easier. Once you have a
                            financial plan, a lot of financial issues relating to savings and expenses get streamlined.
                            Why Personal Finance
                            The main purpose of personal finance education is to positively influence financial
                            behaviour. It has been observed that such education is delivered more effectively to
                            younger children than to their older counterparts. Knowledge of personal finance is
                            beneficial for everyone in many ways.

                        <p>Make your own financial decisions
                            An understanding of personal finance helps you take informed decisions about your
                            financial situation. When you spend money on a particular thing you are giving up
                            something else. For example, if you purchase a book for `. 500/- you are sacrificing
                            maybe, a video game of the same amount or you could have saved that money for the
                            future. There are various alternatives which you could have considered and you have to
                            choose one and forgo the others. What you give up as a result of your buying decision is
                            what we call opportunity cost.
                            Evaluate the advice of financial advisors
                            You may have come across various insurance agents, trying to sell policies or agents for
                            different mutual funds. If you are aware of financial matters then it becomes easy to
                            assess the various alternatives given by financial advisors. Financial advisors usually
                            give you advice and guide you on your savings and investment. They may sometimes
                            make false claims and guarantee high returns on particular investments. Your
                            understanding of personal finance will enable you to determine whether their advice is in
                            your best interests or theirs.
                            Become a financial advisor
                            There are many people who do not understand financial matters or are not interested in
                            taking financial decisions at all. At times, many employees go on paying high taxes
                            because they do not know that by investing in certain securities or contributing to their
                            provident funds they may save on taxes. There is a demand for financial advisors and a
                            course in personal finance or other finance related courses can help you pursue a career
                            as a financial advisor. They usually charge a commission on the amount of investment
                            made from the source of the securities, for example, the post office or the company
                            connected with the mutual funds. At a later stage, if they are enterprising and have a good
                            understanding of financial matters they get paid for their specialised knowledge.
                            Instilling Financial Discipline
                            All of us need to be disciplined when it comes to spending money. If you have to live
                            with a limited income your expenses have to be regulated. Same is true for your pocket
                            money; you have to make sure your money lasts through the whole month. Parents have
                            to make sure that the money is not misused and is judiciously spent.</p>
